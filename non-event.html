      <div>
        <p>A non-event <strong>is</strong> an event but also not one.</p>

        <p>
          It <strong>is</strong> an event because you and other people (that I
          don't know for example) are invited, and might come. It also is an
          event, because there's some kind of consistent acitvity we will all be
          doing (probably).
        </p>

        <p>
          But <strong>it's not</strong> an event because no-one has really put
          much thought into organising it. It's just someone saying "hey let's
          do this", to both some friends and some strangers probably.
        </p>

        <p>
          All this is not to be against fully-fledged events necessarily. It's
          just that the non-event has the advantage that someone can just think,
          "Oh look, it's sunny, would be cool to sit in the park with some
          people and do, read, think or talk about X" (for example).
